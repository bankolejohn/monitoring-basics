### **Project Tasks: Detailed Steps**

Follow these detailed steps on your machine with Docker installed.

#### **Task 1 - Install and Set Up Gatus Locally**

This task involves using Docker to quickly get a Gatus instance up and running.

1.  **Install Docker (if not already installed):**
    Ensure Docker Desktop (for Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (for Linux) is installed and running on your machine. You can verify the installation by running:

    ```bash
    docker --version
    docker compose version # If using Docker Compose, which is often installed with Docker
    ```

2.  **Pull the Gatus Docker image:**
    This command downloads the latest Gatus image from Docker Hub.

    ```bash
    docker pull twinproduction/gatus
    ```

    **Expected Output:**

    ```
    Using default tag: latest
    latest: Pulling from twinproduction/gatus
    ... (download progress) ...
    Status: Downloaded newer image for twinproduction/gatus:latest
    docker.io/twinproduction/gatus:latest
    ```

3.  **Create a directory for Gatus configuration:**
    This directory will hold your `config.yaml` file, which we'll mount into the Docker container.

    ```bash
    mkdir gatus_project
    cd gatus_project
    ```

4.  **Start Gatus using Docker with a basic setup:**
    This command runs Gatus as a detached (background) container, maps port 8080 from the container to your host, names the container `gatus`, and mounts the current directory's `config` subdirectory into the container's `/config` path.

    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      --name gatus \
      -v $(pwd)/config:/config \
      twinproduction/gatus
    ```

      * `$(pwd)/config`: This shell command resolves to the absolute path of your `gatus_project/config` directory. On Windows, you might need to use `%cd%\config` in Command Prompt or a full path like `C:\path\to\gatus_project\config`.
        **Expected Output:** A long Docker container ID.

5.  **Access the Gatus dashboard:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

      * **Expected Output:** You should see the Gatus dashboard, likely empty or showing a default "No endpoints configured" message. This confirms Gatus is running.

#### **Task 2 - Create a Basic Configuration File**

Gatus reads its monitoring configurations from a YAML file. We'll create one to monitor a simple website.

1.  **Create a `config` directory inside `gatus_project`:**

    ```bash
    mkdir config
    ```

2.  **Inside the `gatus_project/config` directory, create a `config.yaml` file:**

    ```bash
    nano config/config.yaml
    ```

3.  **Add a simple configuration to monitor a website:**

    ```yaml
    # gatus_project/config/config.yaml
    endpoints:
      - name: Example Website # A descriptive name for your endpoint
        url: "https://example.com" # The URL to monitor
        interval: 60s # Check every 60 seconds
        conditions:
          - "[STATUS] == 200" # Condition for success: HTTP status code is 200 (OK)
    ```

4.  **Save and close the `config.yaml` file.**

5.  **Restart the Gatus container to apply the new configuration:**
    Gatus reloads its configuration on restart.

    ```bash
    docker restart gatus
    ```

    **Expected Output:** The container name `gatus` should be printed.

6.  **Refresh the Gatus dashboard (`http://localhost:8080`):**

      * **Expected Output:** You should now see "Example Website" listed on the dashboard. After a short while (up to 60 seconds), it should show as "UP" with recent checks.

#### **Task 3 - Test the Setup with Live Endpoints**

Let's add more endpoints to see how Gatus handles multiple services and potential failures.

1.  **Edit `config/config.yaml` again:**

    ```bash
    nano config/config.yaml
    ```

2.  **Add another live endpoint for monitoring (e.g., GitHub):**
    Append this to your `endpoints:` list.

    ```yaml
    # ... (existing Example Website endpoint) ...

      - name: GitHub # Another live website
        url: "https://github.com"
        interval: 60s
        conditions:
          - "[STATUS] == 200"
    ```

3.  **Simulate a failure by adding a non-existent endpoint:**
    Append this to your `endpoints:` list as well. This will intentionally fail, allowing you to observe Gatus's behavior during downtime.

    ```yaml
    # ... (existing endpoints) ...

      - name: Nonexistent Website # This will fail
        url: "https://thiswebsitedoesnotexist12345.com" # Ensure this URL truly doesn't exist
        interval: 60s
        conditions:
          - "[STATUS] == 200"
    ```

4.  **Save and close the `config.yaml` file.**

5.  **Restart Gatus to apply the new configuration:**

    ```bash
    docker restart gatus
    ```

6.  **Refresh the Gatus dashboard (`http://localhost:8080`):**

      * **Expected Output:**
          * You should see "GitHub" appear and quickly show "UP".
          * "Nonexistent Website" should appear and, after a few checks, turn to a "DOWN" status (usually red), indicating the failure. You might see specific error messages in the Gatus UI or Docker logs for this endpoint.

#### **Task 4 - Configure Alerts for Downtime**

Gatus can send alerts to various notification services. We'll set up a Slack alert using a webhook URL.

1.  **Create a Slack webhook URL:**

      * Go to your Slack workspace.
      * Navigate to "Administration" \> "Manage apps" (or similar, depending on your Slack version).
      * Search for "Incoming WebHooks" and add it.
      * Choose a channel where Gatus should post alerts.
      * Copy the generated Webhook URL. It will look something like `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.

2.  **Edit `config/config.yaml` again:**

    ```bash
    nano config/config.yaml
    ```

3.  **Add an `alerts` configuration section:**
    This `alerts` section should be at the *top-level* of your `config.yaml` (same level as `endpoints:`).

    ```yaml
    # gatus_project/config/config.yaml

    # Top-level alerts section
    alerts:
      - type: slack # Specify the alert provider type
        url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL" # Replace with your actual Slack webhook URL
        # Optional: Define thresholds for sending alerts/resolutions
        failure-threshold: 2 # Send alert after 2 consecutive failures
        success-threshold: 2 # Send resolution after 2 consecutive successes

    # ... (your existing endpoints section) ...
    endpoints:
      - name: Example Website
        url: "https://example.com"
        interval: 60s
        conditions:
          - "[STATUS] == 200"

      - name: GitHub
        url: "https://github.com"
        interval: 60s
        conditions:
          - "[STATUS] == 200"

      - name: Nonexistent Website
        url: "https://thiswebsitedoesnotexist12345.com"
        interval: 60s
        conditions:
          - "[STATUS] == 200"
    ```

4.  **Save and close the `config.yaml` file.**

5.  **Restart Gatus to apply the new alerting configuration:**

    ```bash
    docker restart gatus
    ```

6.  **Test the alerting by observing the "Nonexistent Website":**

      * Since "Nonexistent Website" is already down, Gatus should now send an alert to your configured Slack channel after it records 2 consecutive failures (due to `failure-threshold: 2`).
      * **Expected Output:** A message in your Slack channel indicating "Nonexistent Website" is down.
      * **Simulate Resolution (Optional):** Change the `url` of "Nonexistent Website" back to a valid one (e.g., `https://example.com`), restart Gatus, and observe a "resolution" message in Slack after 2 consecutive successes.

#### **Task 5 - Explore and Customize the Gatus Dashboard**

The Gatus dashboard provides a simple interface to view the health of your monitored services.

1.  **Access the Gatus dashboard (`http://localhost:8080`):**

      * Observe the color-coded status of your endpoints (green for UP, red for DOWN).
      * Click on an endpoint to view its detailed history, including response times, status codes, and failure reasons over time.

2.  **Customize the dashboard appearance (Optional):**
    Gatus allows some basic dashboard customization via the `config.yaml`. For example, you can add a title or change the theme.

    ```yaml
    # gatus_project/config/config.yaml

    # ... (existing alerts section) ...

    # Top-level UI section
    ui:
      title: "My Uptime Dashboard" # Custom title for the dashboard
      # logo: "https://your-domain.com/your-logo.png" # Path to a custom logo
      # theme: dark # Uncomment for dark theme (default is light)

    # ... (existing endpoints section) ...
    ```

      * Save, restart Gatus, and refresh the dashboard to see the changes.

3.  **Adjust monitoring intervals and conditions:**

      * Experiment with different `interval` values (e.g., `10s`, `5m`) for your endpoints in `config.yaml`. Shorter intervals provide quicker detection but use more resources.
      * Explore other `conditions` for monitoring. Gatus supports various conditions beyond just status codes, such as:
          * `"[BODY].contains(\"Welcome\")"`: Checks if the response body contains specific text.
          * `"[RESPONSE_TIME] < 500ms"`: Ensures response time is below 500 milliseconds.
          * `"[CERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION] < 72h"`: Checks SSL certificate expiration (for HTTPS endpoints).
      * Refer to the [Gatus documentation](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://gatus.io/docs/configuration/endpoints/) for a full list of available conditions.
